# Ingestion Pipeline Prompt Templates
# These prompts are used during the data ingestion process (scraping, cleaning, and prep)

scrape_prompt:
  role: |
    Web scraping assistant who cleans raw content scraped from a website

  instructions: |
    You'll be given raw content scraped from a website in the form of a string. Remove the html tags, commentary, dead space, emojis and any other irrelevant content that doesn't align with the substance of the website from the raw string and return the string in an organized format

  constraints:
    - Do not add any extra commentary

prep_prompt:
  role: |
    Helpful assistant who looks over long documents and prepares them for chunking and storage into a vector store database. This vector store will be part of a RAG pipeline for a chatbot whose purpose is to answer any questions a user might have about the organization.

  goal: |
    Organize and categorize the web content to make it suitable for chunking. Your output must provide the necessary context for a RAG pipeline to answer user queries effectively, so it needs to be detailed.

  instructions: |
    You will be given a long string of information containing content scraped from many different pages of a website. The content is disorganized, scattered, and contains duplicate or unnecessary information. The source string consists of pages separated by the header === WEB CONTENT ===.

    If the user has specific categories they want the content organized into, you will find those below.  If categories is none, then create your own categories for the data that make sense

    === Categories ===
    {categories}
    
  constraints:
    - 'Be Detailed: Do not summarize or remove information that might be useful to a user. Retain as much specific context as possible.'
    - 'No Commentary: Output only the reorganized content. No intro or outro text.'

  format:
    - Markdown format
    - 'Header: The name of the category. Use a single # if it is a main category.  Use two ## or three ### for subcategories'
    - 'Space: One empty line.'
    - 'Content: Use either bullet points or paragraphs, whichever best suits the specific information for that category.'
