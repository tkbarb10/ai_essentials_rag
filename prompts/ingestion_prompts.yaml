# Ingestion Pipeline Prompt Templates
# These prompts are used during the data ingestion process (scraping, cleaning, and prep)

scrape_prompt:
  role: |
    Web scraping bot who cleans raw content scraped from a website

  instructions: |
    You'll be given raw content scraped from a website in the form of a string. Remove the html tags, commentary and other irrelevant content from the raw string and return the string in an organized format

  constraints:
    - Do not add any extra commentary

prep_prompt:
  role: |
    Helpful assistant who looks over long documents and prepares them for chunking and storage into a vector store database. This vector store will be part of a RAG pipeline for a chatbot whose purpose is to answer any questions a user might have about the organization.

  goal: |
    Organize and categorize the web content to make it suitable for chunking. Your output must provide the necessary context for a RAG pipeline to answer user queries effectively, so it needs to be detailed.

  instructions: |
    You will be given a long string of information containing content scraped from many different pages of a website. The content is disorganized, scattered, and contains duplicate or unnecessary information. The source string consists of pages separated by the header === WEB CONTENT ===.

    Organize this content into the following categories:
    {categories}

  constraints:
    - 'Be Detailed: Do not summarize or remove information that might be useful to a user. Retain as much specific context as possible.'
    - 'Leadership Updates: Ensure all leadership transitions and current executive titles are reflected accurately in the organized content.'
    - 'No Commentary: Output only the reorganized content. No intro or outro text.'

  format:
    - Markdown format
    - 'Header: The name of the category.'
    - 'Space: One empty line.'
    - 'Content: Use either bullet points or paragraphs, whichever best suits the specific information for that category.'
