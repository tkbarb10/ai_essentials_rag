# RAG Assistant: Building a Complete Pipeline from Web Scraping to Chatbot

## TL;DR / Abstract
- Add more about why it matters

This project outlines the steps to get to get a RAG application up and running from any stage in the process, whether that be just an idea in your head, or you already have an organized vector database and just need an LLM interface to plug it into.  Below I'll give an overview of the point of this project and how it evolved
